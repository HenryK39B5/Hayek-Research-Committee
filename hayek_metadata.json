A. Hayek's first discoveries in the New York Public Library in \n1923 was that the war in which he had fought for Austria-the First \nWorld War-had been very different from the one reported in the cen­\nsored Viennese press. Of the many delusions that led to that war, perhaps \nthe most foolish was the assumption that it would be brief and that the \nvanquished would pay for it.", "d the losing \nFrench had paid a sizable indemnity.The source of this delusion was the Franco­\nPrussian War of 1870, which had been quick and tidy, and the losing \nFrench had paid a sizable indemnity.", "pt, as it \nturned out, one against Czarist Russia.The delusion that the 'Great War' would not last long (had the Euro­\npean military leaders paid more attention to the Civil War in the United \nStates they might not have been so eager to fight) meant that govern­\nments saw no reason to raise taxes, particularly if it meant upsetting la­\nbour parties that had vowed to resist any European war except, as it \nturned out, one against Czarist Russia.", "owing abroad, particularly from the United States.Governments first drew upon their financial reserves, confiscating in­\nternational assets of their citizens, shipping gold to neutral countries and \nborrowing abroad, particularly from the United States.When the United \nStates market was closed to Germany and Austria, their governments \nraised money with domestic borrowing, providing reserves to banks to \npurchase bonds which were then sold to patriotic citizens.", "e war; Vienna became a capital without an \nempire.Austria lost everything in the war; Vienna became a capital without an \nempire.The French were determined to make Germany pay reparations \nfor the entire cost of the war; England as well wanted to pass the burden \nof its debt to the United States on to Germany; the United States refused \nto forgive any debt.", "an influx \nof gold, abolished coinage privileges.The United States was the only country to remain on \nthe gold standard; even neutral Sweden, fearing inflation from an influx \nof gold, abolished coinage privileges.At the end of the war there was no \nway to measure effectively the cost of all the conflicting financial claims; \nin effect, the world had moved from the gold standard to a dollar stan­\ndard but with no recognition of what that meant.", "s of production in disarray \nthroughout the world.The result was rampant inflation-hyperinflation in Germany and \nAustria which ruined the holders of bonds, particularly the class to which \n1 \nGOOD MONEY, PART I \nHayek belonged-followed by a steep deflation, especially in the United \nStates, which left commodity prices and costs of production in disarray \nthroughout the world.'Stabilization' became the elusive goal of both cen­\ntral bankers and economists.", "ation of foreign exchange were conflict­\ning aims.Hayek later observed that \"one of the first conclusions at which I re­\nmember I had arrived towards the end of 1923 was that stabilization of \nnational price levels and stabilization of foreign exchange were conflict­\ning aims.But before I could anywhere submit for publication the short \narticle! I had written on the subject, I found that [J.", "domestic \nprice levels and foreign exchange rates.M.] Keynes had just \nstated the same contention in his Tract on Monetary Reform.\"2 \nHayek had recognized a conflict in the need to stabilize both domestic \nprice levels and foreign exchange rates.Most authorities believed that to \nstabilize one would more or less automatically stabilize the other. The \ndegree of dependence on foreign trade would determine which variable \nshould be dominant.", "e \nweight of debts and the claims for reparations.But the emphasis on trade left out of account the \nweight of debts and the claims for reparations.The dislocations of war \nfinance had created a high level of short-term borrowing financed by cap­\nital movements that were sensitive to currency and interest rate changes.", "international financial structure remained shaky.While the real world economy recovered rapidly, albeit unevenly-indi­\nces of production of most commodities were higher in 1928 than they \nwere in 1914-the international financial structure remained shaky.Gold \ncoins no longer circulated, and while the full return of the gold standard \nwas a consummation most devoutly to be wished, actual redemption of \ncurrencies for gold remained severely circumscribed except for the \ndollar.", "1930s is a mat­\nter of more than passing interest.The divergence of theory and practice in the 1920s and 1930s is a mat­\nter of more than passing interest.The conflict between domestic price \nlevels and foreign exchange rates, which meant a disequilibrium between \ninternal and external prices, having been observed by both Hayek and \nKeynes, was largely excluded from their controversy over monetary the­\nory and trade cycles.
